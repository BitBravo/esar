Both Paul and Nancy feel called to be a voice for the bride to walk in the fullness of their dreams and callings. The both are called to be entrepreneurs and ministers who desire for the Lord's heart for women to be released and set free from bondage as part of this movement.  They desire to see women rescued, abortion ended, and orphans cared for. Paul and Nancy reside in Raleigh, North Carolina and have two sons.
