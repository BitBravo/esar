    Would she, could she, dare to rise again?


    It was not because she got thrown to the ground and kicked in the shins or
    blacked out on the floor for the 50th time that cause her not to want to
    rise again. 

     It was not the unpredictable trauma or the many years of sickness or miscarriages that caused her not to want to rise again.  

    She declared she would rise again. 


    It was, however, the worthless feelings and thoughts that were solidified
    deep down in her being, the tormenting question of why this happened to her
    in the first place when she loved Jesus so much.


    Shame kept her down to the ground and fear that she would ever be protected
    for whatever happened. It did not make sense, why her and why so much pain. 


    What was she really up against?  Was the enemy trying to steal her very
    destiny?


    Was she going to be that warrior that she had dreamed about; armor on, sword
    in hand and not afraid of anything! 


    Was she going to hang on to the word of God in her heart, that he had spoken
    to her and through the dreams and visions that he showed her? 


    How could she say yes and rise?


    The Father God was going to keep his promises to her: 

    -the promise of overcoming 

    -the promise of restoration of what was lost 

    -the promise of healing taking place and captives being set free  

    -the promise of answered prayer 

    -the promise of a revival among women 


    Partnering with the Father and Jesus was going to be an adventure that was
    for sure. 


    She had a dream in March 2017 and in that dream she declared, “Esther fasted
    and prayed to change a nation”.  And she heard an audible voice back from
    the Lord. The Lord said  “and you are an Esther and you will change a
    nation”


    Together, will you rise?

    Together we will rise!

    Together with me, will you rise?



    For The Father God knows that you have been called for such a time as this. 


    The Lord is inviting all women to rise up, overcome, and live out God's
    promises for their lives.  


    Esther Arise.
